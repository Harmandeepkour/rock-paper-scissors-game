# 🕹️ Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Hi everyone! I’m **Harmandeep Kour**, a B.Tech student at **NIT Srinagar** IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.  
I’ve just completed my first year, and this is my **first ever Python project**!
I followed the basics from a [FreeCodeCamp.org YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp), and then built on it by adding new features like a **play again** option — which was super fun to create!
